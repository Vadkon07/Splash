# Introduction

This simple code can help you to download YouTube video or audio very fast. In the internet you can find a lot of websites which can do the same things, but usually it takes more time to download your file, and also it's not ad-free. With this simple app you can save a lot of your time!

This app can be very useful if you want to download some music, videos, podcasts etc. I personally use it for my music production hobby (to download samples), and really happy about the quality of audio which I always get.

# Features
1. **Ad-free:** Of course this app is fully ad-free!
2. **No need any API:** To use this app you only have to install some small packages.
3. **Fast download speed:** I noticed that it has much more higher speed than downloads from web-converters.
4. **Terminal-based:** Low CPU, GPU, RAM usage.

## What to install before running a code

In **pip** install **yt-dlp**, and also be sure that you have installed **ffmpeg** on your machine.
