# VideoXYZ

This GUI application allows you to download **YouTube videos** or **audio** quickly and easily. While many websites offer similar services, they often take more time and include ads. With **VideoXYZ**, you can download content directly from **YouTube**, saving both time and hassle! I personally use it for my beatmaking hobby because it's very convenient and fast to download samples from **YouTube**, which I then use for creating melodies.

## Features
1. **Ad-free:** Enjoy a seamless experience without interruptions.
2. **No API Needed:** Download directly without the need for any API keys or extra configuration.
3. **Fast Downloading:** Quickly download videos or audio with minimal delay.
4. **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for a more intuitive experience.
5. **Choose Quality:** Select the video quality that best suits your needs, from low resolution to 4K.
6. **Offline Audio Extraction:** The app downloads videos using the internet but extracts audio offline, saving bandwidth.
7. **Terminal-Based Version Available:** A command-line version of the app is also available in [one of my repositories](https://github.com/Vadkon07/YouTube_Downloader), offering slightly different functionalities.
8. **Optimised for low resolution monitors:** I know that a lot of people continue to use their ThinkPads etc. from 2004 or even older, so I decided to optimise this app for theirs displays. This app should work fine and not take a lot of space on your monitor even if he has only a 640x320 resolution.
9. **Black and white themes:** Also in the future we will add different custom themes as lime, pink, and purple!
10. **Sounds:** We started to add different sounds in our app. For now we have a sound which will notificate you about finished downloading of your files. Soon we also will add some settings for sounds.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- **ffmpeg:** Ensure ffmpeg is installed on your machine for video/audio processing.
- **PyQt6,yt_dlp,pyqtdarktheme:** To install run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Pygame:** We use him for sounds.

## PC Requirements

The app works well on any PC. However, note that for certain operations, such as extracting audio from a two-hour-long video, it may take some time (approximately 5 minutes on an older machine). This performance is quite impressive given that my laptop is very old and struggles to open YouTube itself.

## How to use

1. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Paste the link to your YouTube video when prompted.
3. Choose your download option:
- Click '**MP3**' to download audio (MP3):
- Enter '**MP4**' to download video (MP4)
    - Select a video quality preset:
        - **Worst** for worst quality
        - **480p** for 480p resolution
        - **720p** for 720p resolution
        - **Best** for the best quality
- Enter '**Both**' to download both audio and video
4. Specify the download location path where the files will be saved. Leave blank to download in current directory.
5. The script will process and download the file(s) according to your choices.

## To-Do

When we will finish to do all these tasks - we will release version v1.0. Let's Go!

- [ ] **Playlist Support:** Enable downloading of entire YouTube playlists.
- [ ] **Better Download Indicator:** Improve the download progress indicator to be more user-friendly and hide the raw output from `yt-dlp`.
- [ ] **More Formats:** Expand the format options beyond MP3 and MP4 to include formats like WAV, OGG, and more.
- [ ] **Download Both Audio and Video:** Enhance the app to allow simultaneous downloading of both audio and video.
- [ ] **Descriptions and questions on every page:** Like: "Choose a format".
- [ ] **Hotkeys:** I think that we can add some simple hotkeys, maybe just numbers. Like, if you want to choose 'MP3' click '1'.
- [ ] **Use ffmpeg as less as it's possible, and ideally in one day remove him from our app:** If your PC has a decent CPU + GPU it will be fine, but on my Acer Aspire 5250 to convert 1-minute MP4 video into WEBM takes more than 10 minutes.

## How to read version of app

**In version 1.9.0.1 (example):**

    1: Major revision (new UI, lots of new features, conceptual change, etc.)

    9: Minor revision (maybe a change to a search box, 1 feature added, collection of bug fixes)

    0: Bug fix release

    1: Build number (if used)â€”that's why you see the .NET framework using something like 2.0.4.2709
