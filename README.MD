# Splash

This GUI application allows you to download **images**, **videos** or **audio** from a lot of social media or any websites at all quickly and easily. While many websites offer similar services, they often take more time and include ads. With **Splash**, you can download content directly from litearlly any popular social media, saving both time and hassle! I personally use it for my beatmaking hobby, because it's very convenient and fast to download samples from **YouTube**, which I then use for creating melodies.

You can download videos in any quality, from 144p and up to 4k!

**You downloaded some music with Splash and want to listen to her? Try to do it in our another project [Style Music Player](https://github.com/Vadkon07/Style_Music_Player)!**

## Features
1. **Ad-free:** Enjoy a seamless experience without interruptions.
2. **No API Needed:** Download directly without the need for any API keys or extra configuration. Clone and run!
3. **Fast Downloading:** Quickly download videos or audio with minimal delay. On 99% speed if download depends from your PC specifications and speed of internet.
4. **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for a more intuitive experience. Our app has plenty amount of useful GUI features, which make this app very easy to use even for kids. Some examples: progress bars, a lot of different notifications about changes in app which you do, notifications about new updates (which of course can be installed automaticall).
5. **Choose Quality:** Select the video quality that best suits your needs, from low resolution to 4K. Low resolutions are useful for people which have not a very stable internet, small amount of free storage, low-end computer, or just will be runnerd on a small diplays.
6. **Offline Audio Extraction:** The app downloads videos using the internet but extracts audio offline, saving bandwidth. We are using ffmpeg, a very powerful tool which use every professinal which works a lot with audio/video.
7. **Terminal-Based Version Available:** A command-line (outdated) version of the app is also available in [one of my repositories](https://github.com/Vadkon07/YouTube_Downloader), offering slightly different functionalities. She is pretty outaded for now, but still should work fine. This version will be useful if your computer doens't has a window manager (in two words - for servers).
8. **Optimised for low resolution monitors:** I know that a lot of people continue to use their ThinkPads etc. from 2004 or even older, so I decided to optimise this app for theirs displays. This app should work fine and not take a lot of space on your monitor even if he has only a 640x320 display resolution. On i3 manager you even can change a size of any window which this app will show to you, but I'm not sure about other window managers.
9. **Themes:** Our app has white, black, lime, purple, and pink themes. You can share your own themes with us! Soon we will try to add a gradient themes, which will significanty improve appearance of our app. Also it will be cool to add some custom styled themes as desert, sea, etc.
10. **Sounds:** We have a sound which will notificate you about finished downloading of your files. Soon we also will add some settings for sounds, like custom sounds etc. Also you can enable/disable all sounds inside setting of this app. All sounds which we have in our app are created by myself, by using DAW applications.
11. **Playlists Support (YouTube):** You can download a full album of your favorite artist in one click!
12. **Regular Updates:** This app is always up to date, so you can never care about her availability. After clone of this app you will see information about changes in last update.
13. **Notifications:** We will send to you a notification if it will be available a newer version of this app.
14. **Resources Monitor:** You can always know how busy your PC is. By this monitor you can read how many percent of your RAM or CPU power are filled, and by it you can understand what caused slow conversion or download. Engine of this app I copied from another my project [EasyBench](https://github.com/Vadkon07/EasyBench).

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- **ffmpeg:** Ensure ffmpeg is installed on your machine for video/audio processing.
- **PyQt6, yt_dlp, pyqtdarktheme:** To install run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Pygame:** We use him for sounds.
- **Psutil:** Necessary for Resources Monitor.

## PC Requirements

Here's **recommended** PC specifications:

- **OS:** Linux, Windows, MacOS
- **RAM:** 1GB+
- **CPU:** Intel Pentium 4 or higher
- **GPU:** Just to download audio you don't need GPU, but to do some conversions of **10 minute 1080p** video from one format to another it will be enough something in a kind of Intel UHD630. For **1 hour+ 4k** video processing of course it's better to have a powerful external GPU.
- **Storage:** 500MB (app itself and her packages)

## How to use

1. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Paste the link to your YouTube video when prompted.
3. Choose your download option:
- Click '**MP3**' to download audio (MP3):
- Click '**MP4**' to download video (MP4)
    - Select a video quality preset:
        - **Worst** for worst quality (nice for old computer and slow internet)
        - **480p** for 480p resolution
        - **720p** for 720p resolution
        - **Best** for the best quality (usually 1080p or 4k)
- Click '**Both**' to download both audio and video
- Click '**webm**' to download a video in webm format

4. The script will process and download the file(s) in your **(!) currently choosed directory** according to your choices.

## How to read version of this app

**In version 1.9.0.1 (example):**

    1: Major revision (new UI, lots of new features, conceptual change, etc.)

    9: Minor revision (maybe a change to a search box, 1 feature added, collection of bug fixes)

    0: Bug fix release

    1: Build number (if used)â€”that's why you see the .NET framework using something like 2.0.4.2709

## To-Do for version 2.0

- [x] **Make compatible with other popular social media:** Instagram, Twitter, etc. Add possibility just to download posts or audio from them. Make this app universal!
- [x] **Change requirements.txt:** It doesn't include all packages which should be installed. We have to solve it!
- [x] **Make code more readable:** It will be better to reorganise defs and add/remove spaces in code.
- [ ] **Get a bigger group of developers:** At this moment I create this app fully alone, literally without any help. It will be nice to have a command of 2-3 people, just to work on our app faster. I go to school and have a busy schedule, so I'm not able to code all day long, especially because at home I have some problems with internet connection.
- [x] **Hide custom menu:** Menu bar takes some place, and to get more free space in our app it will be nice to add an arrow which will hide/show this menu. UPDATED: Hm, it's better just to make it for a little smaller.
- [x] **Add resources monitor:** I have a nice project named **EasyBench**, which was created to benchmark your computer. I think that I can copy from his code some things as CPU, RAM, GPU resource monitors and integrate them inside VideoXYZ. It will show usage of computer's resources while using VideoXYZ in terminal or another window, to make it easier for user to understand how busy his computer is. Also I will add possibility to turn it ON or OFF in DEV menu. NOTE: Now it has only RAM and CPU monitor, but we also have to add one monitor for GPU. Also it doens't work in background, and it also should be solver.
- [x] **Better Thumbnail Window:** For now it just open thumbnail in a new window, but what if instead it will show small thumbnail near "Choose a format"?
- [x] **Sound ON/OFF:** Replace it with 'Enable Sound' and 'Disable Sound'. It should read this setting from json and set a needed text. Like, it's already added, but doens't work.

### Last Updated
