# VideoXYZ

This GUI application allows you to download **YouTube videos** or **audio** quickly and easily. While many websites offer similar services, they often take more time and include ads. With **VideoXYZ**, you can download content directly from **YouTube**, saving both time and hassle! I personally use it for my beatmaking hobby, because it's very convenient and fast to download samples from **YouTube**, which I then use for creating melodies.

You can download videos in any quality, from 144p and up to 4k!

**You downloaded some music with VideoXYZ and want to listen to her? Try to do it in our another project [Style Music Player](https://github.com/Vadkon07/Style_Music_Player)!**

## Features
1. **Ad-free:** Enjoy a seamless experience without interruptions.
2. **No API Needed:** Download directly without the need for any API keys or extra configuration. Clone and run!
3. **Fast Downloading:** Quickly download videos or audio with minimal delay. On 99% speed if download depends from your PC specifications and speed of internet.
4. **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for a more intuitive experience. Our app has plenty amount of useful GUI features, which make this app very easy to use even for kids. Some examples: progress bars, a lot of different notifications about changes in app which you do, notifications about new updates (which of course can be installed automaticall).
5. **Choose Quality:** Select the video quality that best suits your needs, from low resolution to 4K. Low resolutions are useful for people which have not a very stable internet, small amount of free storage, low-end computer, or just will be runnerd on a small diplays.
6. **Offline Audio Extraction:** The app downloads videos using the internet but extracts audio offline, saving bandwidth. We are using ffmpeg, a very powerful tool which use every professinal which works a lot with audio/video.
7. **Terminal-Based Version Available:** A command-line (outdated)  version of the app is also available in [one of my repositories](https://github.com/Vadkon07/YouTube_Downloader), offering slightly different functionalities. She is pretty outaded for now, but still should work fine. This version will be useful if your computer doens't has a window manager (in two words - for servers).
8. **Optimised for low resolution monitors:** I know that a lot of people continue to use their ThinkPads etc. from 2004 or even older, so I decided to optimise this app for theirs displays. This app should work fine and not take a lot of space on your monitor even if he has only a 640x320 display resolution. On i3 manager you even can change a size of any window which this app will show to you, but I'm not sure about other window managers.
9. **Themes:** Our app has white, black, lime, purple, and pink themes. You can share your own themes with us! Soon we will try to add a gradient themes, which will significanty improve appearance of our app. Also it will be cool to add some custom styled themes as desert, sea, etc.
10. **Sounds:** We have a sound which will notificate you about finished downloading of your files. Soon we also will add some settings for sounds, like custom sounds etc. Also you can enable/disable all sounds inside setting of this app. All sounds which we have in our app are created by myself, by using DAW applications.
11. **Playlists Support:** You can download a full album of your favorite artist in one click!
12. **Regular Updates:** This app is always up to date, so you can never care about her availability. After clone of this app you will see information about changes in last update.
13. **Notifications:** We will send to you a notification if it will be available a newer version of this app.

NOTE: I made it even better, so for now it can even download updates automatically!
